Naturally it lends itself to an Apple Watch App, so here it is.
I have created a Swift Framework, which could be used from Objtive-C code as well (I did so only for test purposes so far)

Note: Sometimes, you need to rebuild the Swift Framework seperately before the Objective-C App recognizes the correct headers.
